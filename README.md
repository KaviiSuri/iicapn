# IICAPN

IICAPN (pronounced "eye eye cap'n") is supposed to be a simple tool to run databases and other infra locally on your dev environment without any hastle.

## Motiviation

As a developer, I have to run a lot of software locally for my personal and work projects. Dealing with the hastle of installing everything and managing permissions ðŸ˜ª led me to create this.

## How It Works

- IICAPN works on top of **docker** and runs pre-defined (but configurable) containers locally. These configurations are called **Orders**.
- This removes the hastle of installing / configuring databases, message queues and other infra locally.
